This is a simple text editor made from scratch in C++. (Using SFML for window drawing)
Yes, thats it. Nothing fancy, nothing weird. Just a great learning experience.

The editor is functional, you can write text, delete it, select it (keyboard AND mouse support). It has some nice features like swapping text lines.

## Compiling instructions

The editor uses SFML library as graphics controller, so it is needed for compiling. IMPORTANT: Needs version +2.4 !!
See https://www.sfml-dev.org

A working Makefile is included, works great assuming you have sfml installed correctly.

```
make && ./editor
```

## Warning!

Be careful with the data you save!
